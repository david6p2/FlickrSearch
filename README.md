Learning UICollectionViews with https://www.raywenderlich.com/136159/uicollectionview-tutorial-getting-started and https://www.raywenderlich.com/136161/uicollectionview-tutorial-reusable-views-selection-reordering

I follow the UICollectionViews Tutorial to learn about it and understand how it could be used in my future Apps. It's nice how the Cells reorder automatically when you flip the device and how you can select multiple cells and rearrange them.

##Instructions

Just clone and run it on Xcode 8 because it uses Swift 3.
